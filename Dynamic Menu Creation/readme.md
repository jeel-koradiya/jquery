# Jquery Task - Dynamic Menu Creation

## Features:
1. When you click on add button the element entered in the input field will be added to the right side with two buttons edit & remove. And the same value will be added in the default drop-down.

2. When the value is selected from dropdown and value entered from input field, then the value will be added as sub children of the parent ( the element selected in the dropdown will be considered as parent ) in the right side. Similarly at the same time,  new dropdown will be created which contains values of children.

3. On change of dropdown, find the sub-children and create the dropdown for the same containing proper hierarchical structure.

4. On edit, parent/children can be edited and then can be updated ( can't edit any other parent/children while editing ).

5. On remove, the element will be removed and if the element is parent then all the sub-children will be removed too.
